# UWRegistrationBot by Sonnhi Duong

## A bot that automatically registers for classes at UW
I have never used the bot and will continue doing so.
This bot takes your loging information, class codes, and registration time.
One Minute before the registration time, if will fire up the browser and load in all
your inputs. Roughly around 3 seconds before the registration time, the bot will spam 
the submit button with your class information.

This was my personal project using python scripts. 
Some of the main libraries I used was Selenium and SimplePyGUI
Use at your own risk.

## Installation
Install the repo's zip file and extract its contents
Run the Driver executable in the dist folder

## Usage
Once running the UI for the bot will pop up 
Input your login information for your UW Student account and 
fill out the class codes under SLN and your add codes if any for the class
The credit column is optional and is only for variable credit classes
Make sure to use the dropdown and pick the registration time CORRECTLY
Verify all your information is correct before running or else it will not work

Once running the window will close and will run again when its close to the registration date.
You can leave the program running in the background while you do other things

## How to Contribute
Any contributions are greatly appreciated
Some of the things I have yet to get to are
  Testing 
  Debugging
  Better GUI
  Registration Day input

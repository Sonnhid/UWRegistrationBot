Input your login information for your UW Student account and 
fill out the class codes under SLN and your add codes if any for the class.
The credit column is optional and is only for variable credit classes.
Make sure to use the dropdown and pick the registration time CORRECTLY.
Verify all your information is correct before running or else it will not work.

Once running the window will close and will run again when its close to the registration date.
You can leave the program running in the background while you do other things.

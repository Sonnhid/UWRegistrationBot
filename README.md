# UWRegistrationBot
by Sonnhi Duong 

Thank you for using the bot, but use at your own risk

This Bot takes your UW login and codes for the classes you are going to take.
Make sure that al lof the information is correct before registration day. 
The bot tends to stop working if there is an invalid input.
I recomend running the bot the day of registration or just before it. 

How it Works:
After pressing the run button and making sure that all inputs are valid,
The bot will wait til the specified registration time.
30 seconds before the time, it will open up UW and put in all the class codes.
5 seconds before the time, it will start submitting for until classes are registered.

Requirments:
Before actually running, chrome driver would need to be installed to your computer.
Remember to add its path to your computer environment variables and 
specicify the path in the bot.
This will make it so the bot can send data and interact with the website.
